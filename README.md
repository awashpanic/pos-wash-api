## Tech stack

- **Go 1.21** — no framework, plain `net/http`
- [`chi`](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) — routing
- [`gorm`](https://gorm.io) + Postgres driver — persistence
- [`golang-jwt/jwt/v5`](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt) — auth
- [`cloudinary-go`](https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary-go) — media storage
- [`go-playground/validator`](https://github.com/go-playground/validator) — request validation
- [`viper`](https://github.com/spf13/viper) — config from `.env`
- [`air`](https://github.com/air-verse/air) — hot reload in development

## Features

- **Auth** — register, login, JWT-protected profile
- **Outlets** — create, fetch
- **Service categories** — listing
- **Services** — CRUD for wash services and pricing
- **Customers** — CRUD
- **Perfumes** — catalog listing (add-on for orders)
- **Payment methods** — listing
- **Orders** — create, list, detail, status updates, payment
- **Dashboard** — summary stats, order trend
- **Media** — file upload (Cloudinary)

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Go 1.21+, a Postgres database, a Cloudinary account.

1. Copy the env template and fill in your values:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Required: `APP_*`, `POSTGRES_*`, `CLOUDINARY_*`, `JWT_SECRET`.
   (`REDIS_*` keys are present in `.env.example` but unused by the app — leave blank.)

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   go mod download
   ```

3. Run the server:

   ```
   go run ./cmd/main.go
   ```

   Or with hot reload ([air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)):

   ```
   air
   ```

Server listens on `APP_PORT` (see `.env`).

## API

All routes are mounted under `/api/v1/pos`. Public: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`. Everything else requires a `Bearer` JWT from login.

Request/response shapes are documented in the Postman collection linked above — treat it as the source of truth over hand-written docs here.

## Roadmap

This project is under active development. Planned work:

- [ ] Machine management: register wash/dry machines, link to services
- [ ] Machine connection management: pair/connect physical machines to the system
- [ ] Order add-ons: attach perfume to an order, remove it from an order
- [ ] IoT integration: trigger machine operation via MQTT
